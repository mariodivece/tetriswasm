# Tetris WASM
This is a sample project that implements the classic Tetris game in client-side Blazor. The aim is to provide support for the Unotalks presentation of March 12, 2020 and show the most useful concepts in building SPA apps with Blazor:

 - Components
 - Dependency Injection
 - Parameters
 - Cascading Parameters
 - Timers
 - Event Callbacks
 - Events and Event Handlers
 
 The implementation of the game logic is NOT the point of this sample -- but feel free to explore in the hopes you find something useful in it :).
